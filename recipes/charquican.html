    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Charquic√°n is a very seasonal dish in Chile. I mean, if it is summer and in-season green beans, peas, corn are
        added. Same with other vegetables. It is still cooked with pumpkin and the always faithful potatoes if it is
        winter.
    </p>
    <p>
        The name derives from the use of jerky in the preparation. Charqui (jerky) is any smoked and dried meat. It
        could be horse jerky, beef, or even fish. Before refrigerators were popular, this is how meat was preserved.
        Now, it is more common to make it with fresh meat, but the name remains.
