    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        As soon as the Spring starts in Chile, you can find little carts selling this traditional drink Wheat berries with dried peaches or Mote con Huesillos on the streets. A little like the Aguas Frescas in Mexico. It is very filling and a terrific snack if you are sightseeing. Should be served chilled
